Parse-SSH2-PublicKey

Version: 0.01

This module parses SSH2 public keys from text files. It can parse both
OpenSSH and SECSH key file formats and will parse multiple keys out of a
file/text block, even parsing mixed-format files (e.g. a file containing
both OpenSSH- and SECSH-format keys). This module was created to assist
sysadmins in converting from one SSH implementation to another.
